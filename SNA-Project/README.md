1. Project description & hypotheses:

Every genre has its own rules on the construction of sentences. Therefore in different genres sequences of POS distribution differentiates.

Hypothesis 1: in scientific and children's literature the number of neologisms is less than in other genres
Hypothesis 2: in reviews the number of NP containing noun and adjectives is higher than in other genres
Hypothesis 3: in children's literature sentence construction is easier so it's more likely to meet bigrams with tags (adjective, noun) and (noun, verb)

2. Genres:

- Articles (downloaded from az.lib.ru)
- Essays (downloaded from az.lib.ru)
- Narrative (long) (downloaded from az.lib.ru)
- Narrative (short) (downloaded from az.lib.ru)
- Novel (downloaded from az.lib.ru)
- Novella (downloaded from az.lib.ru)
- Reviews (downloaded from turpravda.ru)
- Fairy tales (russian) (collected manually)
- Scientific news (downloaded from nkj.ru)

3. Method

Analyze the sequences of POS distribution by using bigrams within sentences of each genre.
